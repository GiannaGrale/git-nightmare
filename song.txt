I'm sick of tryin' be something that I'm never gonna be
Tryin' to fit in a mold that wasn't meant for me
I just wanna be free to let my mind do its thing
Without the world weighing in
On where my heart should've been
And who I'm supposed to be
And so I draw the line in the sand, my line
Here's to starting over
Here's to no compromise, yeah
Get up or get out of my way (Get up, get up)
Here's to starting over
(Here's to starting over)
(Here's to starting over)
I'd always sworn that I'd fight
To find my own way through, yeah
But the past has a way of coming back for you, oh, oh
I'm just trying to do what I was put here to do
Without the world all assuming, oh
What it is that I do
