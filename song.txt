I'm sick of tryin' be something that I'm never gonna be
Tryin' to fit in a mold that wasn't meant for me
I just wanna be free to let my mind do its thing
Without the world weighing in
On where my heart should've been
And who I'm supposed to be
And so I draw the line in the sand, my line
Here's to starting over
Here's to no compromise, yeah
Get up or get out of my way (Get up, get up)
Here's to starting over
(Here's to starting over)
(Here's to starting over)
I'd always sworn that I'd fight
To find my own way through, yeah
But the past has a way of coming back for you, oh, oh
I'm just trying to do what I was put here to do
Without the world all assuming, oh
What it is that I do
And so I draw the line in the sand, my line
Here's to starting over
Here's to no compromise, yeah
Get up or get out of my way (Get up, get up)
Here's to starting over (Over, starting over, starting over)
I'd rather fail as me than succeed as someone else
There's a world of opportunity for someone like me
I don't need you to choose my direction
I'll pave my own way, and I can make my own mistakes
No matter what it takes
Or what it means for in the days to come
Here's to starting over
Here's to no compromise, yeah
Get up or get out of my way (Get up, get up)
Here's to starting over
